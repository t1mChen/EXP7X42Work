<p align="center"><em>Game Play Screenshot.</em></p>
<p><em>Exp-7X42</em>  is a 5-min timed survival first-person shooting (FPS) game set in a virtual world.
The operators of the experiment is scientists from the real world, while the player is a test participant by the directors
of this experiment. The brain of the player is connected to machines that simulate the test environment, so that their
reactions can be examined by scientists. They have established a standard. Only those who are able to survive for more
than 5 minutes are considered as successful, which means they will remain alive and ready to participate in the future
experiments, otherwise they will be abandoned and executed with death if they fail. You, as one of object being tested,
is required to survive from this 5 minutes simulation hosted by immortal scientists, while seeking for resources and avoid
getting killed by the enemies. The background of the game will be revealed gradually as the game progresses, which leaves
space of imagination for the players themselves to consider.</p>
<p>More information are explained in the background story.</p>
<h3 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h3>
<h4 id="core-concept">Core Concept:</h4>
<p>The game is based in a chemical plant. The player is a “guinea pig” of an immoral organisation. The main goal for the player is to survive for 5 minutes under the attack of enemies, meanwhile searching for resources to stay alive.</p>
<p>The background story is inspired by the novel Hunger Game, written by Suzanne Collins, where the main characters are put into a dangerous environment by an organisation and they need to fight for survival.</p>
<p align="center">

        </p>
<p align="center"><em>Game World Prototype.</em></p>
<h4 id="genre">Genre:</h4>
<p>This is a single-player, First-Person Shooter (FPS), survival game.</p>
<p>A reference game in this genre is <em>bioshock</em>.</p>
<h4 id="target-audience">Target Audience:</h4>
<p>The target audiences are between the age of 15-30 who enjoys: slight-horror, slight-mystery, action game, FPS, 3D game experience, sci-fi theme.</p>
<h4 id="unique-selling-points-usps">Unique Selling Points (USPs):</h4>
<p>There are minimal explicit explanations of the background story given to the player in the game. However, there are little pieces of writings (e.g. notes, diary pages, marks on the wall) that the player might see or find when exploring the world. These can give the player some hints or implications of why he/she is in this place (hints might include fragmented information about the immoral organisation, or news articles about the experiment that the organisation is doing, or even the background story of the player).</p>
<p>Players can build up their understanding about the background story based on the writings they find, but it should be quite open-ended so different players can have different interpretations about the background story; or they might have different understandings the second time they play the game.</p>
<p>Further information and usage regarding this USP's performance within the game play will be explained further in this document.</p>

<h3 id="story-and-narrative">Story and Narrative</h3>
<h4 id="background">Background:</h4>
<p>Backstory and settings: In the future world, some unethical scientists are investigating the adaptability of the human brain in the cyberworld using humans as experimental subjects. Their consciousness is projected into a dangerous virtual world constructed by the scientists. Death in the virtual world means death in real life. The main character is a subject of the experiment and has to fight and survive the attack of hostile creatures in a chemical plant in the virtual world.</p>

<h4 id="conflict">Conflict:</h4>
<p>The main conflict is between the player and the hostile creatures.</p>
<h4 id="progression">Progression:</h4>
<p>There is not a dominant story component that is enforced on the player to experience. However, clues of the background story are hidden in the surroundings and players can choose to unfold the plot based on their interests.</p>

<p>We have 15 pieces of notes that is organised and located within the game world, while each piece of notes contain a little word to reveal about the background story. Here is the list of all notes:</p>

<h5 id="minotaur">Minotaur:</h5>
<p>Normal monsters that attack player, only short-range attack.</p>
<p>These hostile creatures have different specialties.
Some move with faster speed, some have higher health, some have wider range for movement and attacking, some have strength in combat. Hostile creatures can only have close combats.</p>
<p>When the player is within the attacking range of hostile creatures, the hostile creatures would attack automatically.</p>

<p>The field of view is limited to what the character naturally sees, with the camera representing the character's eyes. Camera view can be rotated.</p>
<p>Player character’s body is not visible on screen. However, the gun and the hand holding the gun will be visible at the right-bottom corner. Similar to the picture below:

<h5 id="phase-1---normal">Phase 1 - normal:</h5>
<p>Certain number of hostile creatures to be maintained the game and start wandering around the map (instantiate new when one gets killed).</p>
<p>In this phase, player can explore the surroundings and collect supplies (bullets, healing potion, etc) from supply crates in the scene.</p>
<p>When the player is close to a hostile creature, it will start chasing and attacking the player. Player can either escape or kill the creature with gun.</p>
<h5 id="phase-2---difficult">Phase 2 - difficult:</h5>
<p>A boss and a set number of new hostile creatures appear in the map.</p>
<p>Boss begins chasing the player and has a number of attacking methods.</p>
<p>The boss cannot be killed but only frozen (when the player shoot the boss)</p>
<h5 id="losing-condition">Losing condition:</h5>

        <img src="Images/minotaurH.png" width="500">
        </p>
<p align="center"><em>Minotaur getting hit by bullet.</em></p>
<p>Player Shooting Skill: The game requires precise and responsive aiming.</p>
<p>Fast reaction: Player has to react fast to attack signals in order to dodge attacks from all hostile creatures and the boss. Being able to skillfully survive under enemy pressure gives a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Supply crate interaction: open, close, containing resources (e.g. bullets, healing potion) , provide resources for players to progress the game.</p>
<p>Supply crate generation: When the supply crates existing are below a specific minimum value, new crates will be generated.</p>
<p>Structures: walls, interior settings, floors, set limitations and plot of the environment. Moving objects are unable to directly pass through</p>
<p>Minotaurs: Their role is to stop the player from staying alive. They are able to chase and attack the player by using axes or throwing stones. They will walk separately from each other. New minotaurs will be generated when boss is out from the cage.</p>
<p>Boss is able to throw out more minotaurs, or execute remote attack object via swiping or range attack object via jumping.</p>

<h3 id="levels-and-world-design">Levels and World Design</h3>
<h4 id="game-world">Game World:</h4>
<p>The game is designed in 3D, and the views change as the player moves because the game is played in first person. The game is multi-stage where the stages are separated by the appearance of the boss. Some glowing effects can be used as instructions to attract player as navigation. For example, crates have a glowing boundary to attract player to approach. The player can explore the map by walking around the structures.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Boss Cage.</em></p>
Boss Cage: a modern cage that locks the boss until a certain time (2:30) passes.
<p>Enemies (Minotaurs and Boss as shown above) - Their role is to stop the player from staying alive. Matches with the theme biochemical factory that they are invented by the scientists.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Player object.</em></p>
Player - There is no visual for the players as we are using first person view. This is determined due to the limited scope of the project as well as for disk / memory efficiency measures. There will be a gun model that is attached to the right of the player model.

        </p>
<p align="center"><em>Notes.</em></p>      
<p>Notes (USP) - The notes can be opened by the player so that they can grow their understanding regarding the background theme of the game, as well as for more interactions to change the gameplay. The brightness of the notes will be higher as player walks closer to it for purpose of notification using shaders. It will also contain a wave effect. To further enhance attractiveness, a particle will be added around the notes.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Rifles[16].</em></p>  
<p>Rifles: the player comes up with an default gold rifle, however they have one chance to switch a rifle when they find and interact with the rifles in the lab area. Each rifle have slightly different parameters in rate of fire, weight (impact player speed), and maximum clip load. We have also optimised the material's colour and metalness, smoothness to create better reflections.</p>
<h4 id="physics">Physics:</h4>
<p>Gravity - objects and creatures obey gravity on Earth</p>
<p>Newton’s Law - The player and creatures are able to move around by walking, where gravity is appllied.</p>
<p>Physical Damage - The player’s health is deducted when getting hit from hostile creatures.  Similarly, the creatures' health is deducted when bullets hit their body.</p>
<p>Smoother starting and stopping effect - Apply dragging forces when player begins and stops to move, brings effect of acceleration and deceleration.</p>
<p>Colliders - collider of the enemies is sligthly greater than the mesh model itself to make it not overly difficult for the player to aim the enermies</p>
<p>Knockback effect - There's knockback effect when player or monsters are attacked.</p>
<p>Recoil force - A recoil force is also applied when the player shoots.</p>
<p>Player-Enemy Collision - To provide a smooth, uninterrupted and unblocked gaming experience, the player is able to pass through the minotaurs or the boss. This is a optimised decision that is beneficial to the player.</p>
<h3 id="art-and-audio">Art and Audio</h3>
<h4 id="art-style">Art Style:</h4>
<p>The game has a major art style of science fiction, consisting of futuristic illusions as well as experimental imagination, with plots including concise and spacious layout consisting of modern existing elements and surreal creatures.</p>
<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/09-colourtone.png" width="300">
        </p>
<p align="center"><em>Game Style Concept.[3][8]</em></p>
<p>The overall game has a cold tone graphics that maintains bluish tint, aiming to construct an environment with an atmosphere of callous and ruthless. We achieve this by using many white light sources, regular rectangular shapes as walls, and reflective smooth textures for futurism.</p>
<p>The setting of the game has a strong scientific background, with micro plot in biomedical factories and computer laboratories from the macro perspective. Hence the textures (building blocks) we are using here allow us to construct an unique structure for gamers to explore.</p>
<p>The overall aesthetic has a constitution of futuristism and surrealism with illusion from biochemistry and science. Some relative art styles or concepts are <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> , <em>Doom Eternal</em>.</p>
<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/11-ref.png" width="300">

<p align="center"><em>Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal.[9][10]</em></p>       
<h4 id="sound-and-music">Sound and Music:</h4>
<p>The sound design includes sound effects and background music.</p>
<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/12-sound.png" width="300">
        </p>
<p align="center"><em>Sounds.[11][12][13][14][15]</em></p>  
<p>There are multiple sound effects in this game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security alarm when boss is getting released from cage.</li>
<li>Playing being attacked.</li>
<li>reloading and shooting bullets.</li>
<li>Sound when players is walking.</li>
<li>Various sounds when minotaurs attack the player.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ambient Sci-Fi background music begins after the game is started and in progress, it serves as an auxiliary of the aesthetic design of the scenes, providing the gamers a sense of strangeness and insecurity, an immersive gaming experience overall.</p>
<p>In settings menu, there will be a sound effect of a notification when player changes the sound level of the game to notify the player of current sound level.</p>
<p>In the main menu and lose or winning interfaces, there will be another background music that creates tense, exhibiting as an introductory music towards the scientific and mystery theme of the gameplay to be started. Reflecting the theme of experiments. Enhancing user's understand on context.</p>
<p>There will also be a credits scene with a music that sounds more brighter, which serves as an outro when the player wants to know more about the development team after playing the game contents.</p>

        </p>
<p align="center">
<p align="center">
  <em>Actual Menu UI Design[19].</em>
</p>
<p>The design of the menu UI intends to simulate a control panel on the wall of the scientific (computer) laboratory, with the wall graphics / textures showing behind the selections. This unites the UI layout together with the game background, that is we start the game as we start the scientific experiments.</p>
<p>The options available in the menu are: start, settings and credits.</p>
<p>Since there is no exit function available due to WebGL game environment, in the actual design we have replaced the exit button to credits button.</p>
<p>Clicking the credits button will display credits to developers.</p>
<h4 id="settings-ui">Settings UI:</h4>
<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/19-settingsui.png" width="500">

        <img src="Images/actualSettingsUI.png" width="500">
        </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Actual Settings UI.</em>
</p>
<p>Again, following the same concept, the settings UI forms by similar shapes but different colours since we are on a different page. The music and sound volume rocks also act as a form of control panel, retaining the same game aesthetic design.</p>
<p>There are two metrics to be optimised, which is sensitivity and sound level.</p>
<p>Since we have optimised all of the sound effects and music in a harmonic standard relative to each of its sound level, the user could simply adjust level of all audio at the same time to gain the best experience.</p>
<p>The sensitivity control we've add is major due to under WebGL development, different computers with different display resolutions will provide drastically different sensitivity level by default. Hence users may want to adjust the levels by themselves for their own experience.</p>

</p>
<p>The notes UI involves displaying a transparent scroll block in the middle of the screen on top of the gameplay ui, while the player is playing the game. It is set to be transparent it won't block the player's view of the scene.</p>
<p>When the user closes the window, the effect of USP will be displayed under health bar for a limited time.</p>
<p>The player is able to scroll using the mouse to real all of the story notes message.</p>

</p>
<p>The pause UI involves different shapes as in the plot, we are in the inner layer of the plot (virtual world).</p>
<p>The red colour is to imitate the imagination of the main character (player) in their own mind, so the background will be the current paused gameplay but darkened.</p>
<p>The two options are resume and quit. At any time during the game, players can use Esc to switch between pause and resume.</p>
<h4 id="win--lose-ui">Win / Lose UI:</h4>
<p>When the player loses or win the game, the corresponding UI will POP-UP.</p>

<p>Then the instruction scenes provide users tutorial on basic controls of the game. The user can either skip or read through.</p>
<p>There is only one buttion in each page which &quot;next&quot; and &quot;continue&quot; for the last page.</p>
<p>After either skipping or read through the instruction, the game shows a scene telling players that the simulated enviornment begins to load, the users can click start to begin their journey!</p>
